# Machitare: The Next Generation Agent Creation Framework

Machitare is an innovative agent creation framework designed to revolutionize the way agents are built and deployed. With a focus on multi-model support, real-time streaming capabilities, multi-agent architecture, and multi-processor optimization, Machitare aims to provide a powerful and flexible platform for creating intelligent agents.

## Key Features

- **Multi-model by default**: Machitare supports multiple AI models out of the box, allowing developers to leverage the strengths of different models seamlessly.
- **Real-time streaming**: The default operation mode of Machitare is designed for streaming real-time data, enabling agents to process and respond to data in real-time.
- **Multi-agent architecture**: Machitare is built with multi-agent systems in mind, making it easy to create and manage multiple agents working collaboratively.
- **Multi-processor optimization**: The framework is optimized to take advantage of multi-processor systems, ensuring efficient utilization of computational resources.
- **Protobuf communication layer**: Machitare uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for efficient and structured communication between agents and other components.
- **Containerization with Docker**: The framework is containerized using Docker, providing portability, scalability, and ease of deployment.

## Design Features and Principles

1. **Modularity and Extensibility**:
   - Machitare follows a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily extend and customize various components of the framework.
   - The framework provides well-defined interfaces and abstractions, enabling seamless integration of new models, algorithms, and functionalities.
   - Machitare encourages the development of reusable and interoperable components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

2. **Scalability and Performance**:
   - Machitare is designed with scalability in mind, capable of handling large-scale agent deployments and high-throughput data processing.
   - The framework leverages multi-processing capabilities to distribute workload across multiple cores or machines, ensuring optimal performance.
